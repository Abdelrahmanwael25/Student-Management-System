🎓 Student Grade Management System (C++)A robust, console-based Grade Management System built with C++ using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. This project demonstrates efficient data organization and dynamic memory management.🌟 Key FeaturesStudent Management: Create and manage student profiles (First Name, Last Name, Age).Course Tracking: Register courses with unique IDs and names.Grade Recording: Link students to specific courses with their achieved grades.Dynamic Data Handling: Uses custom dynamic array implementation to manage records without fixed size limits.Statistics: Automatically calculates the class average across all recorded grades.🏗️ System Architecture (OOP)The project is structured into several classes to ensure Separation of Concerns:Student: Handles personal identification data.Course: Represents academic subjects.Grade: Acts as a bridge between Student and Course to store marks.GradeManager: The engine of the system, responsible for memory allocation, adding records, and generating reports.📂 File StructureFileDescriptionStudent.h / .cppDefines the Student entity.Course.h / .cppDefines the Course entity.Grade.h / .cppManages the relationship between students, courses, and marks.GradeManager.h / .cppContains logic for dynamic arrays and data processing.Source.cppThe entry point containing the main() function and test cases.🚀 Getting StartedPrerequisitesA C++ compiler (e.g., GCC, Clang, or MSVC).Installation & ExecutionClone the repository:Bashgit clone https://github.com/YourUsername/Student-Grade-System.git
Compile the source files:Bashg++ *.cpp -o GradeSystem
Run the application:Bash./GradeSystem
📊 Example OutputPlaintextAll Grades:
abdulrahman wael | Math | 95
wael ahmed | Physics | 88

Average = 91.5
🛠️ Technical HighlightsConstructors & Destructors: Managed carefully to prevent memory leaks during dynamic allocation.Encapsulation: Used private members with public getters and setters to protect data integrity.Pass-by-Reference: Optimized performance by passing objects using const& to avoid unnecessary copying.Developed by [Abdulrahman Wael] 👨‍💻
